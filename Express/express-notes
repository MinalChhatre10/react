It help to write less repetitive code while building web- applications
run using - node server.js
npm init
entry point- server.js

install express
-npm install express

sudo npm install -g nodemon
run using -
nodemon server.js

normally code runs on client side
but by using node and express code will run in our own server
it will only deliver the outcome backto user
hence user will not see the code or logic
it all run on server
